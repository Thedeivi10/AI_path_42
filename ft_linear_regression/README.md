# Notes

## Purpose
The aim of this project is to introduce myself to the basic concepts behind machine learning. The program must to predicts the price of a car by using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.

## Introduction to machine learning (google)

ML is the process of training a piece of software , called a model, to make userful predictions or generate content from data.

Types of ML Systems based on how they learn to make predictions or generate content:
	- Supervised learning: This models can make predictions after seeing lots of data with the correct answers and the discovering the connections between the elemenets in the data that produce the correct answers. Are supervised because the human gives thet ML system data with the known correct results. like regression and classification:
		- Regression: Predicts a numeric value.
		-Classification: Predict the likelihood tha something belongs to a category. For example to predict if an email is spam or not.

	- Unsupervised model: make predictions by being given data that does not contain any correct answer.

	- Reiforcement learning: make prediction by gettin rewards or penalties based on actions performed within an enviroment.

	- Generative AI: creates contenct from user input.
